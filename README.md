# hello-world
This is a test project made according to https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

I'm just trying to figure GitHub out. I've done a fair amount of coding before, but I've mostly done it alone and offline. Part of the reason why I made this account was to share some of the things I've come up with while experimenting on my own.
